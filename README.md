# cadavre_exquis
A simple surrealist cadavre exquis game in Python, a pet project undertaken after [MIT 6.001 on EdX.](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.00.1x_11+1T2017/info)

## The game

> Exquisite corpse, also known as exquisite cadaver (from the original French term cadavre exquis)
> or rotating corpse, is a method by which a collection of words or images is collectively assembled. 
> Each collaborator adds to a composition in sequence, either by following a rule
> (e.g. "The adjective noun adverb verb the adjective noun", as in "The green duck sweetly sang the dreadful dirge")
> or by being allowed to see only the end of what the previous person contributed.
